Sudoku game using random numbers and memorial solving

Game programming is not my favorite field of programming but i have tried to put most of my knowledge in a game.

in this game you can choose :

    size of your table
    choose game difficulty from easy to hard
    see the time you spend on a table
    You can choose the program itself to solve the table which is very fast (less than 0.01 ms)

Note : 
    at the beginning of the game you enter the the size of table you want and you wait until it generates a sudoku table,
      it depends on your table size but at maximum it takes less than 15 seconds to genrate a table of size 9*9
